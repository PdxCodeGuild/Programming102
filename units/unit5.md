PDX Code Guild's Full Stack Boot Camps cover a wide variety of subject matter in addition to Python. If you're looking for something to study in the time until your boot camp begins, consider taking a look at the following subjects:

- HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
  - used for layout out web pages
- Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
  - used to style web pages
- HTTP Request/Response Cycle
  - The process of passing data from a website to a web server and back again
- Beginner Javascript
  - code that runs in the browser to make your web pages do cool stuff

If you haven't done so already, go back through the Programming 101 and Programming 102 syllabi and rework all the labs and exercises, attempting each one with a REPL and functions. Also, work through all the exercises provided for all units.
