## Unit 3 Practice

## **Exercise 1**

Create a dictionary of `fruits`. The `name` of each `fruit` will be the **key** and the **value** will be its `price`. 

### **1.1**

Using the `fruits` dictionary:

- Display the `price` of a `fruit`
- Add a `fruit` to the dictionary, print the dictionary to verify its creation
- Remove a `fruit` from the dictionary, print the dictionary to verify its deletion

Output:

    Apples cost $0.65 each
    Added 'grapes': {'apple': 0.65, 'banana': 0.5, 'guava': 0.33, 'grapes': 0.99}
    Removed 'banana': {'apple': 0.65, 'guava': 0.33, 'grapes': 0.99}

### **1.2**

Loop through the dictionary and display each item and its price.

**Output:**

    Fruit Prices
    ------------
    Apple: 0.65
    Banana: 0.5
    Guava: 0.33

### **1.3**

Create another dictionary to represent a `shopping_basket`. 

The keys of this dictionary will be `fruit` names and the values will be the `quantity` of each item in the `shopping_basket`.

Loop through the `shopping_basket` and add up the `grand_total`. With each iteration of the loop, also print out how many of each `fruit` are in the `shopping_basket` and the `sub_total` for that `fruit`.

Display all the `sub_totals` and the `grand_total` to look like a receipt in the terminal. 

**Output:**

    4 Apples: $2.6
    6 Bananas: $3.0
    8 Guavas: $2.64
    -------------
    Grand Total: $8.24
