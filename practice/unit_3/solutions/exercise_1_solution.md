# Unit 3 Practice Solutions

## **Exercise 1 Solution**

### **1.1**

    fruits = {
        'apple': .65,
        'banana': .5,
        'guava': .33
    }

    # Display the price of a fruit
    print(f"Apples cost ${fruits['apple']} each")

    # Add a fruit to the dictionary, print the dictionary to verify its creation

    # add 'grapes
    fruits['grapes'] = .99
    print(f"Added 'grapes': {fruits}")

    # Remove a fruit from the dictionary, print the dictionary to verify its deletion

    # delete the key:value pair at 'banana'
    del fruits['banana']
    print(f"Removed 'banana': {fruits}")


Output:

    Apples cost $0.65 each
    Added 'grapes': {'apple': 0.65, 'banana': 0.5, 'guava': 0.33, 'grapes': 0.99}
    Removed 'banana': {'apple': 0.65, 'guava': 0.33, 'grapes': 0.99}

### **1.2**

    fruits = {
        'apple': .65,
        'banana': .5,
        'guava': .33
    }

    # display the header label
    print("  Fruits  ")
    print("----------")

    # loop through the keys in the fruits dictionary
    fruit_names = fruits.keys()
    for fruit_name in fruit_names:

    # get the price of the fruit using its name as the key
    price_per = fruits[fruit_name]

    # print the item
    print(f'{fruit_name}: {price_per}')

**Output:**

      Fruits  
    ----------
    apple: 0.65
    banana: 0.5
    guava: 0.33

### **1.3**

**The Code:**


    # fruits and their prices per item
    fruit_prices = {
        'apple': .65,
        'banana': .5,
        'guava': .33
    }

    # fruits in the basket and their quantities
    shopping_basket = {
        'apple': 4,
        'banana': 6,
        'guava': 8
    }

    # set the grand_total to zero
    grand_total = 0

    # loop through each fruit in the basket
    for fruit in shopping_basket:
    
        # get the quantity of the current fruit
        quantity = shopping_basket[fruit]

        # calculate the sub_total for current fruit
        sub_total = quantity * fruit_prices[fruit]

        # add the sub_total for the current
        # fruit to the grand total
        grand_total += sub_total

        # print the sub_total for the current fruit
        print(f'{quantity} {fruit.capitalize()}s: ${sub_total}')

    print("-------------")
    print(f'Grand Total: ${grand_total}')

**Output:**

    4 Apples: $2.6
    6 Bananas: $3.0
    8 Guavas: $2.64
    -------------
    Grand Total: $8.24

Keep in mind that this is just one potential solution.
