## Clean Text

Define a function called `clean_text()` that takes in some `text` as a parameter.

- remove all new line characters `\n` from the text
- remove all `punctuation` from the `text`
- convert the entire `text` to `lowercase`
- use the `.split()` method to split the `text` at every space, creating a list of individual words

Finally, `return` the list of lower case words with no punctuation.

    clean_text("How now, Brown Cow?")

    output:
    ['how', 'now', 'brown', 'cow']
