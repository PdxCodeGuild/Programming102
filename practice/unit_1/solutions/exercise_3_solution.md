# Unit 2 Practice Solutions

## **Exercise 3**

**Problem:**
    
    print 'The last letter of 'elephant' is: {'elephant'[8]}')

**Solution:**

1. `SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print('The last letter of 'elephant' is: {'elephant'[8]}'))?`

    Missing open parenthesis on `print()`

2. `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

    Python is having trouble processing the single quotes around `'elephant'` because the string is created using single quotes. This can be solved by either switching the quotes around elephant to double quotes `"elephant"` or by using *escape characters* to include the single quotes.

3. `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

    This problem is the same as **2.**, except with the next `'elephant'` string. Use double quotes instead. 

4. No error message is raised, but the output is not correct

        The last letter of "elephant" is: {"elephant"[8]}

    In order to have the value for `"elephant"[8]` print in the output, the string in the `print()` needs to be an f-string. Simply add a 'f' before the opening quotation mark.

5. `IndexError: string index out of range`

    'Elephant' is 8 letters long, but the positions of letters in a string start at 0. Therefore, the characters in 'elephant' are 0 - 7, making the last letter of 'elephant' at position 7.

Final code:

    print (f'The last letter of "elephant" is: {"elephant"[7]}')

Output: 

    The last letter of "elephant" is: t
