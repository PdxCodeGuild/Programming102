# Unit 1 Practice Solutions

## **Exercise 2**

**Problem:**


**Solution:**

1. `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`  
    
    Missing `:` after `if num < 3`.
   
2. `IndentationError: unexpected indent`

    `prin('thanks for playing!")` is one space too far to the right.
    
3. `SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal`
    
    Mismatched quotes in `prin('thanks for playing!")`. String starts with a single quote and ends with a double
    
4. `SyntaxError: f-string: expecting '}'`
    
    The f-string in the line: `print(f'{num is less than three')` is missing a closing curly bracket after the variable num

5. `NameError: name 'num' is not defined`

    There is no value set for `num`. Define `num` and assign a number to it that will satisfy the condition in the `if` statment
     
6. `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`

    The value of `num` is an integer, which cannot be concatenated to a string. We need to convert `num` to a string using the `str()` function or by converting the string to an f-string.

7. `NameError: name 'prin' is not defined`

    A 't' is missing from the end of `print()`, preventing the function from being found.

Final code:
        
       num = 1
       if num < 3:
           # using an f-string
           print(f'The number is {num}')

           # using str()
           # print('The number is ' + str(num)) 

           print(f'{num} is less than three')

           print('thanks for playing!')

Final output:

    The number is 1
    1 is less than three
    thanks for playing!
