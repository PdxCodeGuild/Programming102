# Unit 2 Practice

## **Exercise 1 - Count the loops**

### **1.1**

Construct a Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) which performs the following on each iteration of the loop:

- Increment a `counter` variable to keep track of the number of loops.
- Ask the user if they would like to loop again.
- If the user enters 'yes', repeat the loop
- If the user enters 'no', end the loop and display the number of loops performed.

    **Output:**

      Again? yes/no: yes
      Again? yes/no: yes
      Again? yes/no: yes
      Again? yes/no: no
      
      The loop ran 4 times.
