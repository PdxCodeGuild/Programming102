# HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

The **HyperText Transfer Protocol** is the communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network (intranet). 

The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with a server and send data back to the "client". The "client" is most often a user's web browser, which makes HTTP requests when a URL is entered into the address bar.
