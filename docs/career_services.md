# Career Services

Between setting up informational interviews, continuing to learn new skills, building projects, and conquering imposter syndrome, the job search can become quite daunting. However, this is exactly when we need to lean on our friends and colleagues at the PDX Code Guild to find the support we need to persevere. 

We offer a variety of services to our students and alumni both during and after the bootcamp which may include:

- Resume review
- LinkedIn & Github profile setup, customization and optimization
- Mock behavioral and technical interviews
- Job search organization and accountability
- Community outreach to increase access to potential job opportunities
- Continued skill-building guidance
- Morale maintenance and battling impostor syndrome (we’ve all been there)


Our goal is to help everyone who is serious about finding a job in tech to find one as quickly as humanly possible by keeping you organized and on track toward success. 

We will consistently work to compile new resources and to provide clear and concise guidelines for making your job search feel productive and worthwhile. We also provide behavioral and tech interview prep and practice sessions where students can practice interviewing in a low-pressure environment to build their confidence for the many real-life interviews they will encounter.

If you have questions about transitioning into a career in tech, we're here for you! 

We look forward to working with each and every one of you. You’ve got the skills, now let’s put them to work!
