# <a id="top"></a>Lab 5 - User Login

[Back to Syllabus](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/Programming102#top)

Create a REPL which allows a user to 'log in'.

Please complete the sections **in order**. Create a working version of 5.1 before attempting 5.2, etc. This will make your life easier. You may also want to consider creating separate `.py` files for each version, so you can refer back to previous working versions.

### **5.1**

Create a dictionary called `profile`

The `profile` should contain **two** **key : value** pairs with keys of `username` and `password` and values of your choosing. They will represent a `username` and `password` for a **single** user.

    username - gandalfTheGrey
    password - noneShallPass!

**Do not** create your profile with the user's username as the key and their password as the value as below:

    'gandalfTheGrey':'noneShallPass'

Define a function called `login()` which will have three parameters for:

- `username_attempt`
- `password_attempt`
- `profile`

If the values passed to the function for `username_attempt` and `password_attempt` match the values at the keys of `username` and `password` found in the `profile`, The `login()` function will `return True`.

If the credentials don't match those in the `profile`, the `login()` function will `return False`

- Create variables for a `username_attempt` and `password_attempt` which will emulate a user's login attempt.

- Pass the `profile` dictionary, `username_attempt` and `password_attempt` to `login()`. Use the boolean that is returned to tell the user whether or not their login attempt was successful.

Output:
```
# successful login
username: gandalfTheGrey
password: noneShallPass!

Welcome, gandalfTheGrey!

# unsuccessful login
username: gandalfTheGrey
password: myPrecious?

Error! Your username or password was incorrect!
```
### **5.2 - Extra Challenge**

Create a REPL that asks the user for their `username_attempt` and `password_attempt` and attempts to log them in.

If their login is **successful**, print a welcome message and end the program.

If their login is **unsuccessful**, ask if they'd like to try again.

### **5.3**

Allow the user **three attempts** to login. If they exceed three attempts without a successful login, tell the user and end the program

Output:

    username: gandalfTheGrey
    password: myPrecious?

    Error! Your username or password was incorrect!

    Enter 'y' to try again, 'n' to quit: y

    You have 2 login attempt(s) remaining...

    username: gandalfTheGrey
    password: foolOfATook!

    Error! Your username or password was incorrect!

    Enter 'y' to try again, 'n' to quit: y

    You have 1 login attempt(s) remaining...

    username: gandalfTheGrey
    password: bilboBaggins!

    Error! Your username or password was incorrect!

    Your login has been unsuccessful three times! Try again later. Goodbye!

### **5.4 - Extra Challenge**

Add support for **multiple** users.

A few things will need to change:

- Instead of one `profile`, you will need a **_list_** of `profiles`. Each `profile` will be a dictionary containing **key : value** pairs with the keys of `username` and `password`.
  
- When the user enters their username and password attempts, loop through the list of `profiles`, pass each `profile` one at time into the `login()` function along with the `username_attempt` and `password_attempt`.

- If the `username_attempt` and `password_attempt` match the values at the keys of `username` and `password` current `profile`, the `login()` function will return that `True` and that user will be logged in. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

### **5.5 - Extra Challenge**

- Define a function called `user_exists()` which will:

  - loop through each `profile` in the `profiles` list
  - check to see if the `username` the user entered already exists within one of the `profile` dictionaries.

  If a user with that `username` already exists, `return True`, otherwise `return False`
  
- Define a function called `create_user()` which:

  - prompts the user for a `username` and `password`.
  - checks to see if the `username` already exists in the `profiles` list using the `user_exists()` function
  - If the `username` is unique and doesn't appear in the `profiles` list, `.append()` it to the `profiles` list.


- Integrate the `create_user()` function into your REPL to allow the user to create a new username.
