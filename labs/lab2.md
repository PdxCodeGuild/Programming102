[Back to Syllabus](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/Programming102#top)

## 2.1

Create a function called `sum_list` which takes in the list of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

```
Numbers: [4, 5, 4, 2, 7, 4, 4, 5, 8, 10]

Sum: 51
```

## 2.2

Create a function called `remove_all` which takes in a list of numbers and a `target` number as parameters. The function will return a new list containing only the numbers that are not the `target` number.

```
Numbers: [4, 5, 4, 2, 7, 4, 4, 5, 8, 10]

Remove: 4
Numbers: [5, 2, 10, 5, 8, 10]

```

## 2.3

Using a Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL), build a list of numbers by asking the user to enter them one at a time. Add each number to a list.

Once the user enters 'done', ask the user to define the `target` number for the `remove_all` function. 

Call the functions using the values the user provides.

```
Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 26

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 93

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 48

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 65

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 37

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 103

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> done


What is the maximum number: 50

You entered [26, 93, 48, 65, 37, 103]

Those numbers to the power of 2 are: [676, 8649, 2304, 4225, 1369, 10609]

The maximum is 50.
The numbers below the maximum are [44, 28, 25]
```
