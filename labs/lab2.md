[Back to Syllabus](https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/Programming102#top)

## 2.1

Create a function called `square_the_numbers` which takes in the list of numbers and returns a list of those numbers all raised to the power of 2.

```
Numbers: [70, 97, 56, 20, 82, 15, 19, 15, 87, 11]

Numbers squared: [4900, 9409, 3136, 400, 6724, 225, 361, 225, 7569, 121]
```

## 2.2

Create a function called `filter_numbers` which takes in a list of numbers and a `maximum` number. The function will return a new list containing only the numbers below the `maximum`.

```
Numbers: [44, 28, 97, 25, 91, 78, 90, 76, 75, 58]

The maximum is 50.
The numbers below the maximum are [44, 28, 25]
```

## 2.2

Using a Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL), build a list of numbers by asking the user to enter them one at a time. Add each number to a list.

Once the user enters 'done', pass the user's list into both functions and display the results.

```
Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 26

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 93

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 48

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 65

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 37

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> 103

Enter a number or 'done' to quit:
> done

You entered [26, 93, 48, 65, 37, 103]

Those numbers to the power of 2 are: [676, 8649, 2304, 4225, 1369, 10609]

The maximum is 50.
The numbers below the maximum are [44, 28, 25]
```
