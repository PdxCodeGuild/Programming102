## Clean Text

Define a function called `clean_text()` that takes in some `text` as a parameter.

- remove all `punctuation` from the `text`
- convert the entire `text` to `lowercase`
- use the `.split()` method to convert the `text` into a list of individual words

Finally, `return` the list of lower case words with no punctuation.


    clean_text("How now, Brown Cow?")

    output:
    ['how', 'now', 'brown', 'cow']
