# Lab 3: Unit Converter

This lab will involve writing a program that allows the user to convert a number between units.

Each version should be accomplished using a **dictionary** and each can be completed without the use of `if`/`elif` statements.

## Version 1

Ask the user for the number of feet, and print out the equivalent distance in meters.

Hint: 1 ft is 0.3048 m.

So we can get the output in meters by **multiplying the input distance by 0.3048**. Below is some sample input/output.

```
> what is the distance in feet? 12
> 12 ft is 3.6576 m
```

## Version 2

Allow the user to also enter the units. Then depending on the units, convert the distance into meters. The units we'll allow are feet, miles, meters, and kilometers.

**Hint:** Try using the unit as the key and the conversion as the value.

```
1 ft is 0.3048 m
1 mi is 1609.34 m
1 m is 1 m
1 km is 1000 m
```

Below is some sample input/output:

```
> what is the distance? 100
> what are the units? mi
> 100 mi is 160934 m
```

## Version 3

Add support for yards, and inches.

```
1 yard is 0.9144 m
1 inch is 0.0254 m
```

## Advanced 1

Now we'll ask the user for the distance, the starting units, and the units to convert to.

You can think of the values for the conversions as elements in a matrix, where the rows will be the units you're converting from, and the columns will be the units you're converting to. Along the horizontal, the values will be 1 (1 meter is 1 meter, 1 foot is 1 foot, etc).

|     | ft       | mi        | m       | km     |
| --- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| ft  | 1        |           | 0.3048  |        |
| mi  |          | 1         | 1609.34 |        |
| m   | 1/0.3048 | 1/1609.34 | 1       | 1/1000 |
| km  |          |           | 1000    | 1      |

But instead of filling out that matrix, and checking for each pair of units (`if from_units == 'mi' and to_units == 'km'`), we can just convert any unit to meters, then convert the distance in meters to any other unit.

Furthermore you can convert them from meters by dividing a distance (in meters) by those same values used above. So first convert from the input units **_to_** meters, then convert **_from_** meters to the output units.

Below is some sample input/output:

```
> what is the distance? 100
> what are the input units? ft
> what are the output units? mi
100 ft is 0.0189394 mi
```
